# Gait-Analysis
CNN-LSTM NetWork 

### Aimed

This deep learning model was built for investigating the influence of *virtual experience and avatar* on gait parameters in real world and virtual environment


### Advantages 
1.  The CNN component of our network initially extracts spatial local features from the sequence of skeletal joint points.
2.  The LSTM component processes these features, capturing spatiotemporal information.
3.  The Attention layer assigns weights to the vectors, identifying which time steps in thesequence hold greater significance for the analysis.
